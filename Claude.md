# The Board Room Coup - Documentary Drama Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains development materials for **"The Board Room Coup"**, a Netflix-style documentary drama based on the November 2023 OpenAI leadership crisis. The project dramatizes the attempted removal of CEO Sam Altman by the company's board of directors, led by co-founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever.

## Purpose

This project transforms real-world events and legal testimony into compelling narrative entertainment. By combining documentary-style realism with dramatic storytelling techniques, we aim to create a series that explores:

- **Power dynamics** in Silicon Valley's most influential AI company
- **Ethical dilemmas** surrounding AGI development and corporate governance
- **Personal relationships** between co-founders turned adversaries
- **The tension** between mission-driven idealism and commercial reality

## Source Materials

### Primary Documents

1. **ilya_sutskever.pdf** (223.6KB)
   - Full deposition transcript from *Musk v. Altman* case
   - Date: October 1, 2025
   - Contains firsthand testimony about:
     - The 52-page memo documenting alleged misconduct
     - Board deliberations and decision-making process
     - The failed merger discussions with Anthropic
     - Ilya's motivations and regrets

2. **Synopsis.md**
   - 6-act dramatic structure
   - Character development arcs
   - Key scenes and thematic elements
   - Framing device (deposition as present-day narrative)

## Creative Approach

### Documentary Drama Format

The project employs a **hybrid format** combining:
- **Talking-head interviews** with key participants (documentary style)
- **Dramatic recreations** of private meetings and conversations
- **Visual evidence** including text messages, emails, and screenshots
- **Deposition framing** to add legal gravitas and contemporary context

### Narrative Structure

**Timeline**: The story spans from OpenAI's founding (2015) to the aftermath (2025)

**Acts**:
1. **Prologue**: The Promise (2015) - OpenAI's idealistic founding
2. **Act I**: The Gathering Storm - Early tensions emerge
3. **Act II**: The Documentation - Ilya builds his case via Mira Murati
4. **Act III**: The Conspiracy - Secret board meetings
5. **Act IV**: The Execution - November 17-18, 2023
6. **Act V**: The Collapse - Employee revolt and reversal
7. **Act VI**: The Aftermath - Present-day reflections

## Key Dramatic Revelations

From the deposition testimony, we've identified several powerful narrative elements:

- **Secondhand Evidence**: Nearly all of Ilya's allegations came from Mira Murati, never verified firsthand
- **Long Planning**: Ilya waited "at least a year" for the right board composition
- **Disappearing Messages**: Used ephemeral emails because "I was worried that those memos will somehow leak"
- **Anthropic Merger**: The weekend chaos included secret merger talks with OpenAI's rival
- **Employee Miscalculation**: Ilya expected neutrality but got revolt
- **Board Inexperience**: "The process was rushed because the board was inexperienced"

## Thematic Core

### Central Questions
1. Can good intentions justify questionable methods?
2. Who should control transformative AI technology?
3. What happens when mission and reality collide?
4. Is corporate governance adequate for existential technology?

### Character Complexity
- No clear villains or heroes
- Multiple perspectives on the same events
- Believable motivations for all parties
- Focus on the human cost of high-stakes decisions

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

- All dramatized events are based on public court documents and testimony
- Where testimony conflicts or memory is unclear, we choose dramatically truthful interpretations
- Character dialogue is fictionalized but grounded in documented communications
- The project aims for fair representation of all perspectives

## Creative Team Notes

This project requires careful balance between:
- **Accuracy** to real events vs. **dramatic license**
- **Technical complexity** vs. **emotional accessibility**
- **Multiple POVs** vs. **narrative clarity**
- **Present relevance** vs. **historical distance**

The deposition format provides natural opportunities for:
- Character reflection and growth
- Dramatic irony (what they knew vs. what happened)
- Mystery elements (revealing information gradually)
- Documentary credibility

## Target Audience

- Tech industry insiders and observers
- Documentary drama enthusiasts
- Viewers interested in corporate intrigue
- AI/tech ethics communities
- Business and leadership audiences

## Comparable Works

- **"The Social Network"** (tech founding drama)
- **"Succession"** (boardroom power dynamics)
- **"The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley"** (tech documentary)
- **"WeCrashed"** (startup rise and fall)
