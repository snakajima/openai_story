# "The Board Room Coup"
## A Documentary Drama - Rough Story Draft

### **Act I: The Gathering Storm**

**Opening:** Present day - Ilya Sutskever in a stark deposition room, lawyers surrounding him. His voice: "I wanted them to become aware of it. But my opinion was that action was appropriate."

**Flashback - One Year Earlier (Late 2022):** 
- Establish OpenAI as the hottest AI company in Silicon Valley, ChatGPT about to launch
- Introduce key players: Sam Altman (charismatic CEO), Ilya Sutskever (brilliant chief scientist and co-founder), Mira Murati (CTO), Greg Brockman (President)
- Show early tensions: Executives leaving Sam's office frustrated, conflicting directives, whispered hallway conversations
- Ilya watching from the shadows, concerned but powerless - the board is stacked with Sam's allies

### **Act II: The Documentation**

**Spring-Summer 2023:**
- Mira Murati becomes Ilya's confidant, sharing screenshots and stories
- Late night meetings where Mira shows Ilya text messages: Sam telling different executives contradictory things about product launches, company direction
- The "Jakub incident" - Sam promises conflicting visions of the company's future to different executives
- Ilya starts keeping a file, but realizes the board dynamics don't allow for action

**The Tipping Point (October 2023):**
- Board member Helen Toner publishes article praising Anthropic (OpenAI's rival) 
- Sam furious, wants Helen removed
- Suddenly, board departures create an opening - the independent directors now outnumber Sam's allies
- Ilya sees his chance: "I had been waiting for a moment when the board dynamics would allow for Altman to be replaced"

### **Act III: The Conspiracy**

**Early November 2023:**
- Secret meeting: Ilya approaches Helen Toner with his concerns
- Helen brings in other independent directors (Adam D'Angelo, Tasha McCauley)
- They ask for evidence - Ilya works frantically to compile his 52-page memo
- Paranoid about leaks, he uses disappearing emails: "I was worried that those memos will somehow leak"
- The memo's explosive allegations: Sam fired from Y Combinator for similar behavior, creating chaos, lying about safety protocols
- The directors meet in secret, sometimes without Sam and Greg present

### **Act IV: The Execution**

**November 17, 2023 - The Day Before:**
- Final secret board meeting - the decision is made
- Ilya's certainty: "Termination." 
- The plan: move fast, announce publicly before Sam can counter

**November 18, 2023 - The Firing:**
- Sam Altman called into a video meeting, told he's terminated
- Simultaneous public announcement - Silicon Valley in shock
- Ilya expects employees to "cheer" or at least be neutral
- Instead: immediate revolt

### **Act V: The Collapse**

- OpenAI employees threaten mass resignation
- Microsoft offers to hire everyone
- Surprising twist: Anthropic reaches out about merger, Dario and Daniela Amodei on calls with the board
- Ilya horrified at merger possibility: "I really did not want OpenAI to merge with Anthropic"
- The board realizes they've miscalculated catastrophically

**The Reversal:**
- Employees demand the board resign
- Helen Toner's shocking statement: letting OpenAI be destroyed would be "consistent with the mission"
- Ilya breaks, tweets his regret
- Within 5 days, Sam is reinstated, the board resigns

### **Act VI: The Aftermath**

**Return to Present - Deposition Room:**
- Ilya admits the process was "rushed," the board "inexperienced"
