# "The Board Room Coup"
## A Documentary Drama - REVISED Based on Deposition Testimony

**Source**: Ilya Sutskever Deposition, October 1, 2025 (*Musk v. Altman*)

---

### **Prologue: The Promise (2015)**

**Opening Scene:** A dimly lit restaurant in Silicon Valley. Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and a young Ilya Sutskever around a table.

**Elon:** "We need to ensure AGI is developed safely, for everyone's benefit. Not for profit, but for humanity."

**Sam:** "A non-profit. Open source. Transparent."

**Ilya:** (leaning forward, excited) "The research possibilities..."

Handshakes. Hope. A shared vision. Title card: "OpenAI is founded as a non-profit to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity."

**Quick montage:** The early days - recruiting scientists, Elon's billion-dollar pledge, the original team united.

**Cut to:** Present Day - **October 1, 2025**

A stark conference room at Cooley LLP, 20th floor, San Francisco. Ilya Sutskever sits across from lawyers. A camera records. Title card: *"Musk v. Altman - Deposition of Ilya Sutskever"*

**Cut to:** Elon's name on a lawsuit filing: *Musk v. Altman*

### **Act I: The Gathering Storm**

**Opening:** Present day - Ilya Sutskever in the deposition room, 10:19 AM. Lawyers surrounding him. Video camera rolling.

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "And did you want them to take action over what you wrote?"

**ILYA:** "I wanted them to become aware of it. But my opinion was that action was appropriate."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "And what action did you think was appropriate?"

**ILYA:** (pause) "Termination."

**Flashback - Late 2022:**
- Title card: "TWO YEARS EARLIER"
- Establish OpenAI as the hottest AI company in Silicon Valley, ChatGPT about to launch
- Introduce key players: Sam Altman (charismatic CEO), Ilya Sutskever (brilliant chief scientist and co-founder), Mira Murati (CTO), Greg Brockman (President)
- Show early tensions: Executives leaving Sam's office frustrated, conflicting directives, whispered hallway conversations
- Ilya watching from the shadows, concerned but powerless - the board is stacked with Sam's allies

**Present Day - Deposition:**

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "How long had you been considering it?"

**ILYA:** "At least a year."

### **Act II: The Documentation**

**Spring-Summer 2023:**

**Scene - Late Night, OpenAI Office:**
Mira Murati approaches Ilya in a hallway.

**MIRA:** (glancing around, lowering voice) "Can we talk? Privately?"

They enter a conference room. Mira pulls out her phone, shows screenshots.

**MIRA:** "Look at this. Sam told Jakub something completely different than what he told me. About the company direction."

Ilya examines the messages, concern growing on his face.

**MIRA:** "There's more. A lot more."

**Series of Meetings (Montage):**
- Mira showing Ilya more screenshots over coffee
- Text messages between Greg and Sam (how did she get these?)
- Screenshots about the "DSB" issue with Jason Kwon
- Mira's performance review of Sam, critical and detailed
- Each time, Ilya's folder grows thicker

**Present Day - Deposition:**

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Most of the screenshots in the memo... where did you get them?"

**ILYA:** "Most of the screenshots that I have... I get them from Mira Murati."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Did you speak to Brad Lightcap about the Y Combinator allegations?"

**ILYA:** "No."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Did you speak to Greg Brockman about the Stripe allegations?"

**ILYA:** "No."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Why not?"

**ILYA:** "It didn't occur to me. I fully believed the information that Mira was giving me."

**The Tipping Point (October 2023):**
- Title card: "OCTOBER 2023"
- Board member Helen Toner publishes article praising Anthropic (OpenAI's rival)
- Sam furious, demands Helen be removed from board
- Ilya meets with Sam about removing Helen - initially agrees it's inappropriate

**Ilya's Narration (Present Day):**
"I thought it was not far from obviously inappropriate. At least at one point, I expressed support for removing her."

- Suddenly, rapid board departures create an opening
- Independent directors now outnumber Sam's allies
- Ilya realizes: this is the moment he's been waiting for

**Present Day - Deposition:**

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "What dynamics were you waiting for?"

**ILYA:** "That the majority of the board is not obviously friendly with Sam."

### **Act III: The Conspiracy**

**Early November 2023:**

**Scene - Video Call with Independent Directors:**
Helen Toner on screen from D.C., Adam D'Angelo from another location, Tasha McCauley remote. Ilya alone in his office.

**ADAM:** "Do you have screenshots? Evidence?"

**ILYA:** "Yes. From Mira mostly."

**ADAM:** "Can you put together a memo? Something we can share?"

**ILYA:** (nods) "I'll do it."

**Compiling the Memo (Visual Sequence):**
- Ilya alone at computer, late night
- Opens folder labeled "Documentation"
- Begins writing: First page appears on screen: *"Sam exhibits a consistent pattern of lying, undermining his execs, and pitting his execs against one another"*
- Inserting screenshots from Mira
- Page count growing: 10 pages... 25 pages... 40 pages... 52 pages
- Creating sections:
  - "Sam was pushed out from YC" (p.529)
  - "Greg was essentially fired from Stripe" (p.531)
  - "Lying to Mira About Jason's Opinion About the DSB" (p.531)
  - "Pitting People Against Each Other" (p.540-542)
  - "The Jakub Story" (p.548)
  - "Subtle Retaliation" (p.564)

**Sending the Memo:**
Ilya hovers over "Send" button. Types email to Helen, Adam, Tasha. Checks box: "Disappearing email."

**Present Day - Deposition:**

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Why did you use disappearing emails?"

**ILYA:** "Because I was worried that those memos will somehow leak."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "What was your concern?"

**ILYA:** "It was a generalized concern."

**Secret Board Meetings:**
- Small conference rooms, just the three independent directors + Ilya
- Reading the memo on tablets, faces grave
- Helen, Adam, Tasha asking questions
- Sam and Greg excluded, unaware
- Discussions late at night, careful planning

**ADAM:** "Have you verified these allegations?"

**ILYA:** "They come from Mira. I trust her completely."

**HELEN:** "This is serious. If this is true..."

**TASHA:** (reading) "Creating chaos, pitting people against each other..."

### **Act IV: The Execution**

**November 17, 2023 (Friday) - The Day Before:**

**Final Secret Board Meeting:**
The independent directors on a video call. Tense silence.

**ADAM:** "So what action do you think is appropriate?"

**ILYA:** (no hesitation) "Termination."

Silence. The weight of the decision.

**HELEN:** "When?"

**ADAM:** "Tomorrow. We move fast. Announce publicly before he can respond."

**ILYA:** "What about the employees?"

**HELEN:** "They'll understand. This is about the mission."

**ILYA:** (uncertain) "I don't think they'll feel strongly either way."

**Present Day - Deposition:**

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Did you expect the employees to cheer?"

**ILYA:** "I had not expected them to cheer, but I have not expected them to feel strongly either way."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "And why is that?"

**ILYA:** "That's what I thought."

**November 18, 2023 (Saturday) - The Firing:**

**Morning - Sam's Home:**
Sam receives video call invite. Joins. Sees board members on screen, not Ilya.

**BOARD MEMBER:** "Sam, the board has made a decision..."

**Simultaneous - OpenAI Office:**
Public announcement goes live. Employees reading on screens, shocked faces.

**Simultaneous - Silicon Valley:**
News spreading like wildfire. Twitter exploding. Tech reporters scrambling.

**OpenAI Office - Afternoon:**
Employees gathering, angry, confused. Not the neutral reaction Ilya expected.

**EMPLOYEE 1:** "They fired Sam? Are you kidding me?"

**EMPLOYEE 2:** "Without Sam, there is no OpenAI."

Ilya watching from his office window. Realization dawning: this isn't going as planned.

### **Act V: The Collapse**

**November 18-19 (Weekend) - Crisis Escalation:**

**Saturday Evening/Sunday:**

**Scene - Board Video Call:**
Helen Toner appears on screen with news.

**HELEN:** "I've been in contact with Anthropic. They're interested in a merger."

**ADAM:** "A merger? Now?"

**HELEN:** "They could take over leadership. Merge with OpenAI. It could solve our problem."

**ILYA:** (visibly upset) "What? No."

**Scene - Call with Anthropic:**
Board on video call. Dario Amodei and Daniela Amodei on screen with another person.

**DARIO:** "We're excited about the possibility. Anthropic leadership would run the combined entity."

**DANIELA:** "Of course, there are practical obstacles to work through..."

**ILYA:** (off camera, to himself) "This is wrong. This is all wrong."

**Present Day - Deposition:**

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Tell me about the Anthropic merger proposal."

**ILYA:** "I don't know whether it was Helen who reached out to Anthropic or whether Anthropic reached out to Helen. But they reached out with a proposal to be merged with OpenAI and take over its leadership."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "What was your response?"

**ILYA:** "I was very unhappy about it."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Why?"

**ILYA:** "Because I really did not want OpenAI to merge with Anthropic."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Why not?"

**ILYA:** "I just didn't want to."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "What about the other board members?"

**ILYA:** "They were a lot more supportive, yes."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Who was most supportive?"

**ILYA:** "My recollection is that Helen was the most supportive."

**The Merger Dies:**
- Anthropic raises "practical obstacles"
- Discussion ends "extremely briefly"
- But employees are now threatening mass resignation
- Microsoft offers to hire entire OpenAI team

**Meeting with Executive Team:**
Executives face the board. Tension thick.

**EXECUTIVE:** "If Sam doesn't return, OpenAI will be destroyed. That's inconsistent with the mission."

**HELEN:** (calmly) "Actually, that would be consistent with the mission."

Shocked silence. Jaws drop.

**Present Day - Deposition:**

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Do you recall Helen saying that?"

**ILYA:** "I do recall."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "What was the context?"

**ILYA:** "The executives told the board that if Sam does not return, then OpenAI will be destroyed, and that's inconsistent with OpenAI's mission. And Helen Toner said something to the effect of that it is consistent, but I think she said it even more directly than that."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "More directly?"

**ILYA:** "Yes."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "And what was your reaction?"

**ILYA:** "I could imagine hypothetical extreme circumstances that answer would be 'Yes'; but at that point in time, the answer was definitely 'No' for me."

**The Breaking Point:**
- Ilya alone in his office, Sunday night
- Hundreds of employees signing letter demanding board resignation
- Everything spiraling out of control
- He opens Twitter, begins typing...

"I deeply regret my participation in the board's actions. I never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we've built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company."

Hesitation over "Tweet" button. Finally, he clicks.

**The Reversal:**
- Within 5 days, Sam Altman is reinstated
- The independent directors resign
- New board formed
- OpenAI survives

### **Act VI: The Aftermath**

**Return to Present - Deposition Room:**

Time stamp: 3:47 PM. Hours into the deposition. Ilya looks tired.

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Looking back at the process that preceded the removal, what's your assessment?"

**ILYA:** "One thing I can say is that the process was rushed."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Why was it rushed?"

**ILYA:** "I think it was rushed because the board was inexperienced."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Inexperienced in what?"

**ILYA:** "In board matters."

**The Core Learning:**

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Do you think it was a mistake to rely on secondhand knowledge?"

**ILYA:** "I think secondhand knowledge can be very useful, but I think that secondhand knowledge is an invitation for further investigation."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "And you've since learned facts that have changed your view?"

**ILYA:** "No. Instead I've learned the critical importance of firsthand knowledge for matters like this."

**May 2024 - Ilya's Departure (Flashback):**

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Why did you leave OpenAI?"

**ILYA:** "Ultimately, I had a big new vision, and it felt more suitable for a new company."

Montage: Ilya packing up his office at OpenAI. Empty shelves. One last look around. Walks out.

**Present Day - The Financial Reality:**

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Do you still have a financial interest in OpenAI?"

**ILYA:** "Yes."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Has the value increased or decreased since you left?"

**ILYA:** "Increased."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Is OpenAI paying your legal fees?"

**ILYA:** "I think that's probably the case."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Why do you think that?"

**ILYA:** "Because I don't know who else it would be."

**The Relationships:**

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "When was the last time you spoke with Sam Altman?"

**ILYA:** "A while ago. Maybe ten months ago, a year ago."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "Have you discussed this lawsuit with him?"

**ILYA:** "No."

**ATTORNEY EDDY:** "When was the last time you spoke with Greg Brockman?"

**ILYA:** "Maybe a year and a quarter ago."

**The Deposition Ends:**

Time stamp: 8:07 PM. Nearly 10 hours. Exhaustion on faces.

Lawyers arguing about unproduc documents (the Greg Brockman memo). Financial questions blocked. Deposition left OPEN, not concluded.

**Final Scene:**

Ilya gathering his things. Walks out of Cooley LLP into San Francisco evening. The Embarcadero lights reflecting on the bay.

**ILYA (Voiceover):** "I've learned the critical importance of firsthand knowledge for matters like this."

Cut to: Sam Altman at OpenAI office, powerful as ever, announcing new AI breakthroughs.

Cut to: Ilya at his new company, Safe Superintelligence, working alone.

**Final Image:** Split screen - Sam and Ilya, both working on AI, now on separate paths.

### **Closing Title Cards:**
- Sam Altman remains CEO of OpenAI
- OpenAI was valued at $150+ billion in 2024
- Ilya Sutskever founded Safe Superintelligence in 2024
- Elon Musk's lawsuit continues through the courts
- The race to AGI accelerates
- Ilya still holds equity in OpenAI. Its value has increased since his departure.

---

## **Thematic Elements:**

### **Central Theme: Firsthand vs. Secondhand Knowledge**
- The entire crisis stems from Ilya's reliance on unverified information from Mira
- "I fully believed the information that Mira was giving me"
- "It didn't occur to me" to verify - repeated throughout
- Core learning: "I've learned the critical importance of firsthand knowledge"
- Visual motif: Information passing through multiple people like a game of telephone
- Reality → Mira → Screenshots → Ilya → Board → Action

### **Power and Ethics in Silicon Valley**
- Who controls transformative technology?
- Can good intentions justify flawed methods?
- The gap between mission statements and human reality

### **Good Intentions, Catastrophic Execution**
- Ilya genuinely believes he's protecting OpenAI's mission
- "At least a year" of consideration, but process "rushed" and "inexperienced"
- Every step taken with certainty leads to disaster
- The board that tried to save OpenAI nearly destroyed it

### **Mission vs. Reality**
- Helen's shocking statement: destruction would be "consistent with the mission"
- Ilya's response: "definitely 'No' for me"
- When does ideological purity become destructive extremism?
- The tension between AI safety concerns and organizational survival

### **Trust and Verification**
- Ilya's complete trust in Mira: "I fully believed"
- Never spoke to: Brad Lightcap, Greg Brockman, Jason Kwon, Diane Yoon, Peter Welinder, Bob McGrew, Nick Ryder
- The danger of acting on assumptions
- How well do we really know what we think we know?

### **Personal Betrayal and Broken Relationships**
- Co-founders turned adversaries
- Last spoke to Sam "ten months ago, a year ago"
- Last spoke to Greg "a year and a quarter ago"
- Still financially tied to OpenAI but personally estranged
- Complex loyalties: OpenAI pays his legal fees, but he's testifying in lawsuit against them

### **The Passage of Time and Reflection**
- Present day (October 2025) looking back at crisis (November 2023)
- Nearly two years for reflection and learning
- Measured, careful testimony vs. rushed, emotional decisions
- What time reveals about our certainties

## **Visual Style:**

### **Documentary-Drama Hybrid**
- **Deposition Frame**: Harsh fluorescent lights, Cooley LLP conference room, 20th floor
  - Time stamps progressing: 10:19 AM → 8:07 PM
  - Video camera recording (as in actual deposition)
  - Lawyers in suits, papers everywhere
  - Ilya's exhaustion building through the day
  - Attorneys' Eyes Only watermark on screen

### **Flashback Recreations**
- **2015 Prologue**: Warm, hopeful lighting - idealistic beginnings
- **Late 2022-Spring 2023**: Growing shadows, corporate thriller aesthetic
- **Summer 2023 (Mira meetings)**: Late night, blue computer screens, secret conversations
- **October-November 2023 (Conspiracy)**: Dark conference rooms, isolated figures
- **Crisis Weekend**: Chaotic, handheld camera, multiple locations cutting rapidly
- **Aftermath**: Cold, empty offices, distance

### **Visual Motifs**

**The Screenshots:**
- Physical manifestation on screen
- Floating text messages
- Phone screens shown to camera
- Building into the 52-page memo visualization
- Visual representation of secondhand evidence chain

**The Telephone Game:**
- Show reality happening (actors in scene)
- Cut to Mira seeing it
- Cut to Mira's screenshot of it
- Cut to Ilya reading screenshot
- Cut to Ilya describing it to board
- Cut to board acting on it
- Visual demonstration of information degradation

**The Memo:**
- Page count building: 10... 25... 40... 52
- Sections appearing on screen with page numbers
- Disappearing email UI ("Message will disappear in 24 hours")
- Being read on multiple tablets simultaneously

**The Deposition Room:**
- Camera angles: Over-the-shoulder on Ilya (vulnerable)
- Wide shots showing all lawyers (surrounded)
- Close-ups during emotional moments
- Time stamps marking passage of long day
- Coffee cups accumulating
- Light changing through windows (morning → evening)
- Tension building with attorney conflicts

**The Crisis Weekend:**
- Split screens: Multiple locations simultaneously
- Twitter feed scrolling in background
- Employee Slack messages multiplying
- News headlines appearing
- Clock ticking forward
- Real-time urgency

**Parallel Timelines:**
- Seamless transitions between 2025 deposition and 2023 events
- Question in deposition → Visual answer in flashback
- Ilya's voice continuing over flashback scenes
- Present-day Ilya watching his past self's decisions

### **Character-Specific Visuals**

**Ilya:**
- Often alone in frame, isolated
- Scientific precision in movements
- Glasses reflecting computer screens
- Voice: measured, careful, understated

**Mira:**
- Always in motion, showing phone
- Shadowy, information broker
- Motivations unclear - audience wondering

**Helen:**
- Remote on video screens (she lives in D.C.)
- Ideological certainty in posture
- Cold determination

**Sam:**
- Largely absent from Ilya's POV
- Empty chair at firing
- More powerful in absence than presence
- Only fully seen in epilogue

**The Board:**
- Small rooms, video calls, isolation
- Never all together physically
- Disorganized, inexperienced

### **Documentary Elements**
- Title cards with dates and locations
- Exhibit numbers appearing on screen
- Page citations from deposition
- News footage from November 2023
- Real tweets (Ilya's regret tweet)
- Wall Street Journal article visuals

### **Color Palette**
- **2015**: Warm golds and oranges (hope)
- **2022-2023**: Cool blues and grays (corporate, clinical)
- **Crisis Weekend**: Harsh whites and deep shadows (chaos)
- **Deposition 2025**: Neutral, flat, fluorescent (aftermath, reflection)

---

## **Why This Works Dramatically:**

### **The Deposition Frame Creates:**
- **Built-in narrative structure**: Questions guide the storytelling
- **Dramatic irony**: We learn gradually what happened, creating mystery
- **Reflection and growth**: Present-day Ilya can comment on past decisions
- **Legal stakes**: Reminds us this has consequences years later
- **Time compression**: 10-hour deposition gives natural act breaks

### **The Secondhand Evidence Theme Provides:**
- **Visual storytelling**: Can show the "telephone game" explicitly
- **Audience participation**: We see reality, then see the distorted version
- **Moral complexity**: Ilya isn't lying, he genuinely believed wrong information
- **Universal resonance**: Everyone has acted on incomplete information

### **The Character Arcs:**
- **Ilya**: Certainty → Doubt → Wisdom (tragic but growth)
- **Helen**: Principled → Extremist → Gone (ideological purity taken too far)
- **Mira**: Information Source → Question Mark (What were her motives?)
- **Sam**: Absent → Triumphant (vindicated by absence)

### **The Revelations Build:**
1. Ilya compiled memo from screenshots
2. All screenshots from Mira
3. Never verified any of it
4. Board was inexperienced and rushed
5. Anthropic merger talks (shocking)
6. Helen's destruction statement (more shocking)
7. Everything collapses in 5 days
8. Present day: Ilya learned, but relationships broken forever

This structure stays true to the factual record while creating compelling dramatic narrative with universal themes.
