## LOGLINE

In November 2023, Ilya frantically compiles a 52-page memo from unverified screenshots, sends it via disappearing email to avoid leaks, and meets secretly with independent board members who decide on "termination"—all while the deposition reveals he never spoke to any of the people accused.

---

## ONE-PARAGRAPH SUMMARY

November 2023: Independent directors request a formal memo. Ilya works alone compiling 52 pages of allegations—all from Mira, none verified. Paranoid about leaks, he uses disappearing emails. The deposition reveals the devastating pattern: "Did you speak to Peter Welinder?" "No." "Bob McGrew?" "No." "Why not?" "It didn't occur to me." A list of 7-8 people, all unverified (✗). In secret board meetings, Ilya presents his case. The independent directors read the memo and believe it without investigation. On November 17, they make the decision. Adam asks: "What action is appropriate?" Ilya responds with one word: "Termination." They plan to act fast the next day. Ilya, certain he's right, can't sleep that night. Tomorrow, everything changes.

- **Adam D'Angelo**: Careful but ultimately convinced, asks key questions
- **Tasha McCauley**: Quieter presence, goes along with consensus
- **Sam Altman**: Completely unaware, about to be blindsided

**MIRA'S PRESENCE**: Felt throughout (her information) but not physically present
