# Episode 2: "The Documentation"

**Series**: The Board Room Coup
**Runtime**: 60 minutes
**Written by**: [TBD]
**Directed by**: [TBD]

## LOGLINE

Over spring and summer 2023, CTO Mira Murati secretly feeds Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever a growing file of screenshots documenting the CEO's alleged misconduct, which Ilya compiles without ever verifying—until an October board shakeup creates the opportunity he's been waiting for.

---

## ONE-PARAGRAPH SUMMARY

Picking up from Mira's revelation, this episode chronicles the systematic documentation period of Spring-Summer 2023. Through a series of late-night meetings, Mira shows Ilya screenshots of Sam's contradictory communications—the "Jakub incident," performance reviews, text messages. Ilya trusts her completely and compiles everything without verification. In deposition, he admits: "I fully believed the information Mira was giving me" and "It didn't occur to me" to check with anyone. The tipping point arrives in October 2023: board member Helen Toner publishes an article praising rival Anthropic, enraging Sam. Ironically, rapid board departures shift power to independent directors—the moment Ilya's been waiting for. He realizes Helen, whom he initially wanted removed, is now his key ally.

**INTRODUCED**: Adam D'Angelo, Tasha McCauley (independent directors)

**CLIFFHANGER**: Anticipation, plan forming

**Overall Episode Emotion**: Secretive, methodical, patient → Opportunity emerges

## THEMES

- **Trust Without Verification**: Central theme established
  - "I fully believed" - complete trust
  - "It didn't occur to me" - systemic failure to verify

## CLIFFHANGER

Independent directors ask Ilya to compile a formal memo with his evidence. Freeze on Ilya's face as he realizes this is the moment he's been waiting for—the board composition is right, he has documentation, and they're asking him to make the case. He's about to cross the Rubicon.
