- Tasha: Quiet
- Ilya: Off-camera, seething
- "I just didn't want to"

**ACT V: THE COLLAPSE** (50 min) - November 18-20, 2023

**The Anthropic Proposal** (12 min):

**Deposition INTERLUDE 1** (4 min) - October 2025:
- Q: "Tell me about the Anthropic merger proposal."
- A: "I don't know whether it was Helen who reached out to Anthropic or whether Anthropic reached out to Helen. But they reached out with a proposal to be merged with OpenAI and take over its leadership."
- Q: "What was your response?"
- A: "I was very unhappy about it."
- Q: "Why?"
- A: "Because I really did not want OpenAI to merge with Anthropic."
- Q: "Why not?"
- A: "I just didn't want to."
- Q: "What about the other board members?"
- A: "They were a lot more supportive, yes."
- Q: "Who was most supportive?"
- A: "My recollection is that Helen was the most supportive."

**Back to the proposal**:
- Board discussing after Anthropic call
- Helen: "This could solve our problem. Anthropic's leadership is aligned with the mission."
- Adam: "What about OpenAI's independence?"
- Helen: "What independence? We're about to lose everyone to Microsoft."
- Ilya: "No. This is wrong. We can't just hand OpenAI to a competitor."
- Helen: "They're not a competitor in that sense. They share our values."
- Ilya: "I really don't want to merge with Anthropic."
- Helen: "What do you want then? Everyone quits, we have nothing."
- Ilya: Isolated, realizing he's lost control of his own coup

**Practical Obstacles**:
- Anthropic raises concerns (unstated in testimony)

**The Destruction Statement** (15 min) - The Crisis Meeting:

- Meeting: Board members + Executive team
- Executives present their case:
  - "If Sam doesn't return, OpenAI will be destroyed"
  - "700 employees will leave"
  - "Microsoft will take them all"
  - "The company will cease to exist"
  - "This is inconsistent with OpenAI's mission"
- Tension thick
- All eyes on board
- Helen speaks:
  - "Actually, that would be consistent with the mission."
  - Calm, matter-of-fact delivery
- **Shocked silence**
- Jaws dropping
- Executives stunned
- Even Adam and Tasha look uncomfortable

**DEPOSITION INTERLUDE 2** (5 min) - October 2025:
- Q: "Do you recall Helen saying that?"
- A: "I do recall."
- Q: "What was the context?"
- A: (explains the meeting)
- Q: "And she said destroying OpenAI would be consistent with the mission?"
- A: "Something to the effect of that it is consistent, but I think she said it even more directly than that."
- Q: "More directly?"
- A: "Yes."
- Q: "What was your reaction?"
- A: "I could imagine hypothetical extreme circumstances that answer would be 'Yes'; but at that point in time, the answer was definitely 'No' for me."

**Ilya's Breaking Point**:
- After meeting, Ilya alone
- Realization: He's aligned with someone willing to destroy OpenAI
- This isn't what he wanted
- He wanted to save OpenAI, not destroy it
- Helen has taken mission purity too far
- Everything is wrong

**The Pressure Mounts** (13 min):
