## SERIES OVERVIEW

### High-Concept Logline

A chief scientist's attempt to save his AI company by firing its CEO backfires catastrophically within five days, teaching him the hardest lesson of his career: the critical importance of firsthand knowledge.

### Extended Logline

In November 2023, OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever led a board coup to fire CEO Sam Altman, believing he was protecting the company's mission—but acting on entirely secondhand information. Within five days, the entire company revolted, 700+ employees threatened to quit, and the board capitulation was complete. Through Ilya's October 2025 deposition testimony in the Musk v. Altman lawsuit, we watch the conspiracy unfold, the execution fail, and learn the devastating lesson: he never verified a single allegation himself.

### Series Premise

"The Board Room Coup" is a documentary-drama hybrid that uses sworn deposition testimony as a framing device to tell the inside story of one of the most spectacular corporate failures in Silicon Valley history. Structured as a 6-episode limited series, it follows Ilya Sutskever from idealistic co-founder to failed conspirator to humbled learner, revealing how good intentions, secondhand information, and inexperienced governance nearly destroyed the most important AI company in the world.

### Core Question

How does a brilliant scientist, working with incomplete information and the best intentions, make a catastrophic decision that destroys relationships, nearly kills the company he's trying to save, and teaches him that the most important knowledge is the kind you verify yourself?

### Why Now?

- **Timely**: AI is the defining technology of our era
- **Relevant**: OpenAI and ChatGPT are household names
- **Accessible**: True story with public documentation (deposition)
- **Universal**: Themes of trust, verification, leadership apply beyond tech
- **Dramatic**: Corporate coup is inherently compelling
- **Complete**: Story has natural beginning, middle, end (5-day crisis)
- **Prestige**: Documentary-drama format elevates material

### Format Justification

**Limited Series (6 episodes)**:
- Perfect alignment: 6-act story structure = 6 episodes
- Prestige format (like Chernobyl, Queen's Gambit)
- Binge-friendly weekend viewing
- Premium platforms (HBO, Netflix, Apple)

**Breaking** (Ep 5): Horror, isolation, breaking point
**Aftermath** (Ep 6): Reflection, regret, wisdom, moving on

**Arc**: Hope → Concern → Conspiracy → Chaos → Collapse → Wisdom

---

### Humor

**Use Sparingly**:
- Occasional light moments in early episodes
- Silicon Valley absurdism (when authentic)

**Flashbacks**: Varies by episode intensity
- Ep 1-2: Moderate, building
- Ep 3: Tense, methodical
- Ep 4: Fast, urgent
- Ep 5: Dark, heavy
- Ep 6: Slow, reflective (except reversal)

---

## MUSIC AND SOUND DESIGN

### Composer Direction

**Style**:
- Contemporary, understated
- Electronic elements mixed with orchestral
- NOT bombastic or overly dramatic
- Intimate, psychological
- Silence is powerful tool

**Influences**:
- Hildur Guðnadóttir (Chernobyl) - minimalist, tense
- Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross (Social Network) - electronic, cool
- Nicholas Britell (Succession) - character themes, subtle

---

- **Isolation**: Quiet, reflective, solo instrument
- **Deposition**: NO MUSIC (sacred space for admissions)
- **Split screen**: Dual themes (Sam's theme / Ilya's theme)
- **Final "Yes"**: Complete silence through credits

---

### Key Musical Themes

**1. Ilya's Theme**:
- Thoughtful, scientist, searching
- Piano or strings
- Evolves from certain (Ep 3) to broken (Ep 5) to wise (Ep 6)

**2. Mission Theme**:
- "AGI benefits all of humanity"
- Idealistic, hopeful (Ep 1)

- Returns at end (both still pursuing mission)

**3. Conspiracy Theme**:
- Electronic, rhythmic, building
- Secondhand information motif
- Screenshots, texts, unverified

**4. Deposition Theme**:
- Minimal or none
- When present: Single sustained note, documentary feel

---

### Sound Design Strategy

**Deposition**:
- **Room tone**: HVAC hum, empty office building
- **Specifics**: Papers rustling, water poured, chairs, pens
- **Voices**: Close-miked, clear, legal recording quality
- **Silence**: Used dramatically for key admissions
- **No music**: During testimony (except transitions)

**Flashbacks**:
- **Rich environments**: Full soundscapes
- **Tech sounds**: Keyboards, mouse clicks, phone notifications
- **Office ambience**: People talking (background), coffee machines
- **Phone screens**: Notification sounds, screenshot sounds
- **Crisis sounds**: Slack pings multiplying (Ep 4), text avalanche

**Transitions**:
- **Dep → Flash**: Sound fades out/changes completely
- **Flash → Dep**: Music fades, room tone fades in
- **Audio bridge**: Occasionally Ilya's voice bridges scenes

---

## THEMATIC GUIDE

### PRIMARY THEME: Firsthand vs. Secondhand Knowledge

**Thesis**: "The critical importance of firsthand knowledge" (Ilya, Ep 6)

**Manifestation**:
- **Ep 1-2**: Information chain established (Reality → Mira → Screenshots → Ilya)
- **Ep 3**: Systemic non-verification (7-8 people, none contacted)
- **Ep 4-5**: Consequences of acting on secondhand info
- **Ep 6**: Lesson learned, stated explicitly

**Visual Representation**:
- Phone screens glowing (information mediated)
- Screenshots shown (secondhand evidence)
- Video calls (not in-person, removed)
- Deposition: Direct questioning reveals gap

**Dialogue**:
- "I get them from Mira Murati"
- "It didn't occur to me" (repeated)
- "I fully believed the information"
- "I should have verified it myself"
- "I should have spoken directly to people"

**Series Message**:
Verify. Don't trust secondhand. Firsthand knowledge is critical.

---

### SECONDARY THEME: Certainty vs. Doubt

**Arc**:
- **Ep 1-3**: Past Ilya certain, confident
- **Ep 4-5**: Certainty shatters, doubt floods in
- **Ep 6**: Present Ilya knows he was wrong

**Manifestation**:
- **Ep 3**: "Termination" said with no hesitation
- **Ep 3**: Night before coup, "absolutely certain"
- **Ep 4**: "I had not expected them to feel strongly"
- **Ep 5**: Everything wrong, certainty destroyed
- **Ep 6**: Regret, "Yes" to "Do you regret it?"

**Dramatic Irony**:
- Audience sees flaws Ilya doesn't (deposition reveals)
- Past Ilya certain, present Ilya regretful
- Contrast creates tension and tragedy

**Message**:
Certainty without verification is dangerous. Doubt is wisdom.

---

### THEME: Mission vs. Reality

**Setup**: "AGI benefits all of humanity" (founding mission)

**Tension**:
- Mission justifies action (Ilya's perspective)
- But actions nearly destroy company (reality)
- Helen: Destroy company if "consistent with mission"
- Ilya: "Definitely No for me" (chooses reality over ideology)

**Resolution**:
- Both Sam and Ilya still pursuing mission (Ep 6 split screen)
- But from different companies, separated by what happened
- Mission continues, but human cost was high

**Message**:
Ideological purity can be destructive. Pragmatism matters.

---

### THEME: Trust Without Verification

**Pattern**:
- Ilya trusts Mira completely
- Board trusts Ilya (he trusts Mira)
- No one verifies anything
- Cascade of unverified trust

**Breakdown**:
- **Ep 2**: "I fully believed the information"
- **Ep 3**: ✗ NOT VERIFIED checklist grows
- **Ep 6**: "I should have verified"

**Message**:
Trust is not enough. Verify.

---

### THEME: The Power of the People

**Setup**: Board can fire CEO (structural power)

**Reality**: Employees can bring down board (real power)

**Manifestation**:
- **Ep 4**: 700+ signatures demanding board resign
- Unified voice more powerful than 4 board members
- Microsoft offer gives employees alternative
- Board has no leverage without employees

**Message**:
Real power lies with the people, not the board.

---

### THEME: Isolation and Connection

**Visual Motif**: Glass walls (Ilya separated)

**Arc**:
- **Ep 1**: Co-founder, connected (2015)
- **Ep 1-2**: Observing, separated by glass (2022-23)
- **Ep 3-5**: Conspiracy isolates him further
- **Ep 6**: Complete isolation - "No" relationships with Sam/Greg

**Cost**:
- Friendships destroyed
- Founding team broken
- Ilya alone

**Message**:
Actions have relational consequences. Isolation is costly.

---

### THEME: Good Intentions, Flawed Execution

**Ilya's Perspective**:
- Believes he's protecting OpenAI
- Believes he's serving the mission
- Believes he's doing the right thing

**Reality**:
- Nearly destroys OpenAI
- Backfires completely
- Wrong about everything

**Tragedy**:
- He meant well
- But methodology fatally flawed
- Good intentions + bad process = catastrophe

**Message**:
Good intentions are not enough. Process matters.

---

### THEME: Secondhand Information Telephone Game

**Visual Chain**:
```
REALITY (what actually happened)
  ↓
Observed by someone
  ↓
Told to Mira
  ↓
Mira's interpretation
  ↓
Screenshot/text taken out of context
  ↓
Shown to Ilya
  ↓
Ilya's interpretation
  ↓
Compiled in memo (with Ilya's framing)
  ↓
Read by board
  ↓
Board's interpretation
  ↓
Decision made
```

**Degradation**: Each step removes context, adds interpretation

**Message**:
Information degrades through transmission. Go to source.

---

### THEME: Speed of Modern Crisis

**Timeline**: 5 days (Friday → Wednesday)

**Acceleration**:
- Social media (Twitter explosion)
- Slack (instant employee organizing)
- News cycle (24/7 coverage)
- No time to course-correct

**Message**:
Modern communication accelerates crises. No time to think.

---

### THEMATIC RESOLUTION

**Episode 6 delivers**:
1. **Explicit thesis**: "Critical importance of firsthand knowledge"
2. **Human cost**: Relationships destroyed
3. **Financial irony**: Wealthier but lost everything else
4. **Moving forward**: Both still pursuing mission, separately
5. **Regret**: "Yes" (final word)

**Series leaves audience with**:
- Clear lesson: Verify firsthand
- Human tragedy: Good person, catastrophic mistake
- Ongoing story: Mission continues (both Sam and Ilya)
- No villain: Complexity, not simplicity
- Wisdom through failure: Learning possible

---

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Budget Considerations

**Scale**: Mid-to-High Budget Limited Series

**Major Costs**:
1. **Cast**: Known actors for prestige (Ilya, Sam, Mira especially)
2. **Locations**: San Francisco tech office (OpenAI HQ) - extensive use
3. **Deposition room**: Studio build, multiple episodes
4. **VFX**: Screen graphics, social media interfaces, video calls
5. **Music**: Original score, composer
6. **Post**: Extensive editing (dual timeline structure)

**Cost Efficiencies**:
1. **Deposition**: Single location, reuse across all episodes
2. **Limited cast**: Focused on core characters
3. **Office interiors**: Can be studio builds
4. **Video calls**: Simple backgrounds, no travel
5. **Limited VFX**: Mostly screen graphics, practical

**Comparable Budgets**:
- **Chernobyl**: ~$130M for 5 episodes (~$26M/episode)
- **The Dropout**: ~$8-12M per episode
- **WeCrashed**: ~$10-15M per episode

**Estimated Range**: $8-15M per episode, $48-90M total

---

### Shooting Schedule

**Prep**: 12-16 weeks
**Principal Photography**: 60-80 shoot days
**Post-Production**: 24-30 weeks

- Russian accent, scientist credibility
- Emotional range (certain → broken → wise)

**Priority 2**: Sam Altman
- Recognizable figure, charisma essential
- Less screen time but powerful presence
- Must be complex (not villain)

**Priority 3**: Mira Murati
- Key supporting role
- Ambiguity essential (casting must support)
- Chemistry with Ilya actor

**Priority 4**: Board members (Helen, Adam, Tasha)

- Screen compositing (what's on phones/computers)
- Possibly crowd extension (employee gathering)

**Practical First**:
- Real screens whenever possible
- Practical phones/tablets/laptops
- VFX enhancement, not full creation

---

### Post-Production Complexity

**Editing Challenges**:
- Dual timeline structure (2015-2024 + 2025)
- Seamless transitions (deposition ↔ flashback)
- Pacing across 6 episodes
- Building tension despite known outcome

- ADR for clarity

**Color Grading**:
- Distinct looks (deposition vs. flashback)
- Consistency across episodes
- Color palette shifts by episode mood

**Music**:
- Original score composition
- Recording sessions
- Mix and placement

---

### Distribution Strategy

**Platform Priority**:
1. HBO/Max (pitch first)
2. Netflix (strong alternative)
3. Apple TV+
4. Hulu/FX
