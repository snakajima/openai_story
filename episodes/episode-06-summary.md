# Episode 6: "The Aftermath"

**Series**: The Board Room Coup
**Runtime**: 52 minutes
**Written by**: [TBD]
**Directed by**: [TBD]

---

## LOGLINE

In the aftermath of his failed coup, Ilya Sutskever learns the hardest lesson of his career—the critical importance of firsthand knowledge—while a 2025 deposition reveals the bitter irony that the board crisis only made him wealthier and that he hasn't spoken to his former friends in over a year.

---

## ONE-PARAGRAPH SUMMARY

Within five days of the attempted coup, the board reverses course completely: Sam returns as CEO, the independent directors resign, and Ilya—though he signs the employee letter—loses all influence. He stays at OpenAI for six more months, working on his Superalignment team but isolated. In May 2024, he quietly departs. The October 2025 deposition dominates this episode (25 minutes total), revealing the devastating lessons learned, the broken relationships (hasn't spoken to Sam in "ten months," to Greg in "a year and a quarter"), and the bitter financial irony: his equity increased, OpenAI is paying his legal fees, and he's wealthier than ever. The core admission: "The critical importance of firsthand knowledge." The series ends on a split screen—Sam at OpenAI continuing the mission, Ilya at his new company Safe Superintelligence, both working toward AGI, separated by the chasm of what happened.
