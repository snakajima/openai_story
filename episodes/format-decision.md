## II. FORMAT OPTIONS ANALYSIS

### **OPTION 1: Feature Film (120 minutes)**

**Pros**:
- ✓ Prestige format (Academy Award eligible)
- ✓ Theatrical release potential
- ✓ Focused, streamlined narrative
- ✓ Clear three-act structure
- ✓ Budget efficiency

**Cons**:
- ✗ Must cut 60% of material (~200 minutes)
- ✗ Loses richness of documentation period
- ✗ Cannot explore character depth
- ✗ Deposition framing would be minimal
- ✗ Mira's role would be reduced to plot device
- ✗ Board dynamics oversimplified
- ✗ Thematic complexity sacrificed

**Comparable Films**:
- "The Social Network" (120 min) - Tech founding, deposition framing
- "Margin Call" (107 min) - Corporate crisis in tight timeframe
- "All the President's Men" (138 min) - Documentary-style investigation

**Assessment**: ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED**
- Too much material to compress
- Documentary-drama hybrid needs breathing room
- Character complexity requires time
- The 5-day crisis alone needs 90+ minutes

---

### **OPTION 2: 4-Episode Limited Series (4 x 60 min = 240 minutes)**

**Proposed Structure**:
- **Episode 1**: Prologue + Acts I-II (The Gathering & Documentation)
- **Episode 2**: Act III (The Conspiracy)

**Pros**:
- ✓ Tight, focused storytelling

**Comparable Series**:
- "The Dropout" (Hulu) - 8 episodes but could have been tighter

**Assessment**: ⚠️ **POSSIBLE BUT TIGHT**
- Could work but would feel rushed
- Documentation period (Act II) deserves full episode
- Crisis weekend (Acts IV-V) needs two episodes minimum

---

---

### **OPTION 4: 8-Episode Limited Series (8 x 50-55 min = 400-440 minutes)**

- **Episode 2**: Act I Part 2 + Act II Part 1
- **Episode 3**: Act II Part 2
- **Episode 4**: Act III Part 1
- **Episode 5**: Act III Part 2
