## LOGLINE

November 18, 2023: Sam Altman is fired as OpenAI CEO in a Saturday morning video call, shocking Silicon Valley—but instead of the neutral reaction Ilya expected, employees immediately revolt, threatening mass resignation, and by evening the panicked board is hearing about a potential Anthropic merger.

---

## ONE-PARAGRAPH SUMMARY

Saturday morning, November 18, 2023. The plan executes: Sam is fired via video call, a public announcement drops simultaneously, and Silicon Valley explodes. But Ilya's expectations catastrophically fail—employees aren't neutral, they're furious. "Without Sam, there is no OpenAI." By afternoon, an employee letter demanding the board resign accumulates 700+ signatures. Microsoft offers to hire the entire company. The board's leverage evaporates. In an evening emergency call, panic sets in. Then Helen mentions: "I've been in contact with Anthropic. They could merge with us, take over leadership." Ilya's face: horror. This isn't what he wanted at all.

  - Immediate organization
  - Clear message: Board must go

- **Helen Toner**: Firm on mission, introduces Anthropic option

## THEMES

- **Expectations vs. Reality**:
  - Ilya: "Not feel strongly either way"
  - Reality: Immediate unified revolt
  - Catastrophic miscalculation

- **The Power of the People**:
  - Board can fire CEO
  - But employees can bring down board
  - 700+ voices > 4 board members
  - Real power lies with the workers

- **Acting on Secondhand Knowledge Fails**:
  - Secondhand info about Sam → Fire him → Wrong
  - Secondhand assumptions about employees → Also wrong
  - Everything built on sand

- **Unintended Consequences**:
  - Tried to save OpenAI → Nearly destroying it
  - Tried to protect mission → Company might cease to exist
  - Every action backfires

- **Speed of Modern Crisis**:
  - One morning → Global news → Employee revolt → All leverage gone
  - Social media, Slack, instant communication
  - No time to course-correct

---

## VISUAL STYLE

**Parallel Action**:
- Split screens: Multiple locations simultaneously

**Social Media Explosion**:
- Twitter feeds scrolling
- News alerts popping
- Slack messages multiplying
- Visual information overload

**The Signature Counter**:
- Visual: 100, 300, 500, 700+

**Ilya at Window**:
- Above, looking down at gathering
- Isolated, separated by glass (motif returns)
- Powerless observer again (like Episode 1, full circle)

**Video Call Boxes**:
- Board separated, not physically together
- Each in their own box
- Isolation even while communicating

**Color/Light**:
- Morning: Gray, early light
- Afternoon: Harsh daylight
- Evening: Darker, shadows growing
- Visual: One day, darkness falling

**Pacing**: Fast, almost real-time, urgent

## CLIFFHANGER

As the board panics about the employee revolt and Microsoft's offer, Helen drops a bomb: Anthropic could merge with OpenAI and take over leadership. Freeze on Ilya's horrified face—this is completely wrong. They tried to save OpenAI from Sam, now they might hand it to a competitor? How did they get here?
