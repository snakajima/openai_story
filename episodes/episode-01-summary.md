## LOGLINE

A deposition reveals the shocking decision to fire OpenAI's CEO, then flashes back to the company's idealistic founding and the first signs of trouble eight years later, culminating in a CTO secretly showing the Chief Scientist evidence against the CEO.

---

## ONE-PARAGRAPH SUMMARY

In October 2025, Ilya Sutskever sits for a videotaped deposition and admits he recommended "termination" of Sam Altman. We flash back to 2015, when Elon Musk, Sam, and Ilya founded OpenAI with pure intentions to ensure AGI benefits humanity. Fast forward to late 2022: OpenAI is the hottest AI company, but Ilya observes troubling patterns in Sam's leadership. Board composition prevents him from acting. He's been considering Sam's removal for "at least a year" but is powerless. Then, in a late-night encounter, CTO Mira Murati nervously approaches Ilya with screenshots of Sam's contradictory communications. "There's more," she says. "A lot more."
