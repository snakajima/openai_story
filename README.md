# OpenAI Story

This is my attempt to create a Netflix mini series based on the [deposition by ILYA SUTSKEVER](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.433688/gov.uscourts.cand.433688.340.1.pdf)
published on October 1st, 2025.

I created an initial synopsis using Claude (Opus 4.1), 
then asked Claude Code to come up with a development plan (Plan.md).
