   firsthand knowledge for matters like this.

A: Yes.
```

**PAGE 325** - "Planning" vs. Waiting:

```
Q: And what were the dynamics you were waiting for?

```

### Mira Murati as Primary Source

**PAGE 129** - The Screenshots:

THE WITNESS: So the way I wrote this document was to -- the context
for this document is that the independent board members asked me to
prepare it. And I did.

And I was pretty careful. Most of the screenshots that I have that
I -- most or all, I don't remember. I get them from Mira Murati.

It made sense to include them in order to paint a picture from a
large number of small pieces of evidence or items.
```

**PAGE 309** - The Y Combinator Story:
```
Q: Am I right the basis for this is a conversation that Mira had
   with Brad Lightcap?

A: No.
```

**PAGE 310** - Full Belief in Mira:
```
Q: Why didn't it occur to you?

ATTORNEY AGNOLUCCI: Object to form.

THE WITNESS: I -- it just didn't.

   was giving me.
```

**PAGE 314** - Who Told About Daniela vs. Mira:

```
Q: Tell me about that.

A: I don't -- I don't know whether it was Helen who reached out to
   Anthropic or whether Anthropic reached out to Helen. But they
   reached out with a proposal to be merged with OpenAI and take
   over its leadership.

Q: When was that?

A: On Saturday.

Q: Saturday, November 18th?

A: That must be the day.

Q: The day -- was it short -- shortly after the removal of Sam and Greg?

A: Yes. It was before -- it was either on Saturday or on Sunday.
   It was not on Monday.
```

**PAGE 320** - Ilya's Reaction:

### Employee Reaction Surprise

**PAGE 326** - Expected Employee Response:
```
Q: [Reading from WSJ article] "Sutskever was astounded. He had
   expected the employees of OpenAI to cheer."

   Is that true?

A: I had not expected them to cheer, but I have not expected them
   to feel strongly either way.

Q: And why is that?

Q: After Sam was removed, do you recall Helen Toner telling employees
   that allowing the company to be destroyed would be consistent with
   the mission?

A: I do recall.

Q: And what was the context of that comment?

A: The executives -- it was a meeting with the board members and the
   executive team. The executives told the board that, if Sam does not
   return, then OpenAI will be destroyed, and that's inconsistent with
   OpenAI's mission.

And Helen Toner said something to the effect of that it is consistent,
but I think she said it even more directly than that.

Q: More directly than you've related here?

A: Yes.
```

**PAGE 307-308** - Ilya's Reaction:
```
Q: And what was your reaction to that?

A: I don't remember my reaction at the time.

Q: Did you think that would be consistent with the mission?

ATTORNEY AGNOLUCCI: Object to form.

THE WITNESS: I could imagine hypothetical extreme circumstances that
answer would be "Yes"; but at that point in time, the answer was
definitely "No" for me.
```

**DRAMATIC SIGNIFICANCE**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**PAGE 169** - The Reversal Timeline:

   Sam and Greg from the board, what's your assessment of that process?

ATTORNEY AGNOLUCCI: Objection. Vague. Calls for speculation.
Lacks foundation.

THE WITNESS: Can you elaborate on what you mean.

BY ATTORNEY EDDY:

Q: You've had time to reflect on -- on the process that preceded
   the removal; right?

A: I had time.

Q: And in reviewing the steps that preceded the removal, do you think
   that process was correct?

ATTORNEY AGNOLUCCI: Same objections. Lacks foundation. Calls for
speculation. Vague.

THE WITNESS: One thing I can say is that the process was rushed.

   recall it was praising Anthropic.

## XIV. TENSION MOMENTS - Attorney Conflicts

```
ATTORNEY MOLO: Look, it doesn't have to be directly relevant.
So it's certainly relevant.

BY ATTORNEY MOLO:

Q: In any event, do you recall --

ATTORNEY AGNOLUCCI: Well --

ATTORNEY MOLO: Let me ask a question.

ATTORNEY AGNOLUCCI: Well, you've interrupted me in the middle of
making an objection. So let me finish.

ATTORNEY MOLO: That's all you've done the entire deposition is object.

ATTORNEY AGNOLUCCI: That's my job. So --

ATTORNEY MOLO: Actually, it's not.

ATTORNEY AGNOLUCCI: -- if he has a privacy interest in his financial
information --

ATTORNEY MOLO: You've -- you've designated this highly confidential
from the outset.

ATTORNEY AGNOLUCCI: That doesn't mean that he has to answer your question.

Why is it relevant?

ATTORNEY MOLO: It's relevant whether or not he was losing value of
his -- of his equity or whether he thought he was at the time.
```

**PAGE 353** - The Breakdown:
```
ATTORNEY MOLO: Are you refusing to answer the question?

ATTORNEY AGNOLUCCI: He's following my instruction.

ATTORNEY AGNOLUCCI: I am allowing the witness to speak.

ATTORNEY MOLO: No, you're not.

ATTORNEY AGNOLUCCI: Be courteous and respectful.

ATTORNEY MOLO: You be courteous and respectful.

(Indiscernible cross-talk.)

THE COURT REPORTER: The court reporter is noting for the record that
it cannot be taken due to simultaneous cross-talk. Once counsel can
continue with decorum in a professional manner, the record will resume.

Let's take five.

ATTORNEY MOLO: Yeah, don't raise your voice.

ATTORNEY AGNOLUCCI: I'm tired of being told that I'm talking too much.

```
THE WITNESS: Right now, my view is that, with very few exceptions,
most likely a person who is going to be in charge is going to be
very good with the way of power. And it will be a lot like choosing
between different politicians.

BY ATTORNEY EDDY:

Q: The person in charge of what?

A: AGI.

Q: And why do you say that?

ATTORNEY AGNOLUCCI: Object to form.

THE WITNESS: That's how the world seems to work. I think it's very --
I think it's not impossible, but I think it's very hard for someone
who would be described as a saint to make it. I think it's worth
trying. I just think it's -- it's like choosing between different
politicians.

Who is going to be the head of the state?
```

## XXIII. DIALOGUE OPPORTUNITIES

### RECONSTRUCTED CONVERSATIONS (Not directly testified to, but implied):

**Ilya & Mira** (Summer 2023):
```
MIRA
Look at this. [Shows phone]

ILYA
What is it?

MIRA
Sam told Jakub something completely different
than what he told me. About the company direction.

ILYA
Can you send me that?

MIRA
[Sends screenshot]
There's more. A lot more.
```

---

**Ilya & Adam D'Angelo** (Early November 2023):
```
ADAM
Do you have screenshots? Evidence?

ILYA
Yes. From Mira mostly.

ADAM
Can you put together a memo? Something we
can share with Helen and Tasha?

ILYA
I'll do it.
```

---

**Board Meeting** (November 2023):
```
ADAM
So what action do you think is appropriate?

ILYA
Termination.

[Silence]

HELEN
When?
```

---

**Anthropic Call** (November 18-19):
```
DARIO
We'd be interested in a merger. Anthropic
leadership would run the combined entity.

ILYA
[Visibly unhappy]

HELEN
I think we should seriously consider this.

ILYA
I really don't want to merge with Anthropic.

ADAM
What are the practical obstacles?
```

---

**After Helen's Statement** (November 19):
```
EXECUTIVE
If Sam doesn't return, OpenAI will be
destroyed. That's inconsistent with the mission.

HELEN
Actually, that would be consistent with the mission.

[Shocked faces]

ILYA
[To himself, later]
No. The answer is definitely no.
```

## XXIV. WRITER'S NOTES - Using This Testimony

### FOR DIALOGUE:
- Ilya's voice: careful, qualified, understated
- Use actual quotes where powerful
- "It didn't occur to me" as repeated motif
- Short, emotional responses: "I just didn't want to"

### FOR STRUCTURE:
- Present-day deposition as frame device
- Flashback structure triggered by questions
- Cross-cut between testimony and events
- Time stamps showing long day (10:19 AM → 8:07 PM)

### FOR CHARACTER:
- Ilya: idealistic scientist, naive about human dynamics
- Mira: information gatekeeper (mysterious motivations)
- Helen: ideologue willing to destroy company for principles
- Sam: (absence in testimony speaks volumes)
- Board: inexperienced, rushed, overwhelmed

### FOR THEMES:
- **Firsthand vs. Secondhand Knowledge**: Central theme
- **Good Intentions, Flawed Execution**: Ilya's arc
- **Mission vs. Reality**: Helen's extremism
- **Trust and Verification**: "I fully believed"
- **Power and Control**: Who should lead AGI?

### FOR TENSION:
- Use attorney conflicts to show ongoing stakes
- Build tension through day (morning calm → evening breakdown)
- Intercutting past/present creates dramatic irony
- Financial interests add layer of complication

### FOR EMOTIONAL BEATS:
- Ilya's certainty → doubt arc
- "At least a year" of waiting → rushed execution
- Control → loss of control
- Belief → learning

### MYSTERIES TO EXPLORE:

   - Why gathering evidence against him?
   - Personal or professional?

6. **How did Mira get private Greg-Sam texts?**
   - Surveillance? Access to systems?

7. **What really happened with Jakub?**
