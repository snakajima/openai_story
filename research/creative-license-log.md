## I. GUIDING PRINCIPLES

### **Three-Tier System**

**TIER 1 - CANNOT CHANGE (Documented Facts)**
- ✓ Direct quotes from deposition
- ✓ Dated public events (firing, reinstatement)
- ✓ Sworn testimony about who was present
- ✓ Documented exhibits (52-page memo exists)
- ✓ Timeline of major events
- ✓ Outcomes of decisions

**TIER 2 - CAN INTERPRET (Documented but Room for Drama)**
- ◐ Emotional states (based on testimony but embellished)
- ◐ Dialogue in private meetings (we know they happened, not exact words)
- ◐ Motivations (inferred from actions and testimony)
- ◐ Atmospheric details (late night, shadows, etc.)
- ◐ Internal thoughts (based on testimony but dramatized)

**TIER 3 - CAN INVENT (Not Documented)**
- ○ Specific dialogue not under oath
- ○ Visual details of settings
- ○ Minor characters and interactions
- ○ Transitional scenes
- ○ Emotional reactions not testified to
- ○ Background and context scenes

---

## II. MAJOR EVENTS - FACT VS. INTERPRETATION

### **2015 - OpenAI Founding**

**DOCUMENTED FACT** (Tier 1):
- ✓ OpenAI founded in 2015
- ✓ Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Ilya Sutskever were founders
- ✓ Non-profit structure
- ✓ Mission: Ensure AGI benefits all of humanity

**DRAMATIC LICENSE** (Tier 3):
- ○ Restaurant scene (visual invention)
- ○ Specific dialogue: "We need to ensure AGI is developed safely..."
- ○ Handshakes, tone of hope
- ○ "Research possibilities" - Ilya's excitement

**JUSTIFICATION**: Historical record confirms founding and mission, but intimate details of founding conversations not documented in deposition

**TRANSPARENCY NOTE**: Opening scene is dramatization of known facts

---

### **Late 2022 - Ilya Begins Considering Removal**

**DOCUMENTED FACT** (Tier 1):
- ✓ Ilya considered Sam's removal for "at least a year" before November 2023 (p.325)
- ✓ Timeline calculation: Started late 2022 or earlier

**CAN INTERPRET** (Tier 2):
- ◐ Ilya's emotional state: "concerned but powerless"
- ◐ Watching executives leave Sam's office frustrated
- ◐ Board composition preventing action

**DRAMATIC LICENSE** (Tier 3):
- ○ Specific scenes of frustration
- ○ Visual: Ilya "watching from the shadows"
- ○ Hallway conversations
- ○ "Whispered conversations"

**JUSTIFICATION**: Testimony confirms "at least a year" of consideration; atmosphere and specific scenes are dramatic interpretation of that extended consideration period

**TRANSPARENCY NOTE**: Time period confirmed, specific incidents are illustrative

---

### **Spring-Summer 2023 - Mira Shares Information**

**DOCUMENTED FACT** (Tier 1):
- ✓ "Most of the screenshots that I have... I get them from Mira Murati" (p.129)

- ✓ Screenshots included in 52-page memo
- ✓ Ilya: "I fully believed the information that Mira was giving me" (p.310)
- ✓ Ilya: "I was pretty careful" (p.129)

**CAN INTERPRET** (Tier 2):
- ◐ Late night meetings (inferred from secretive nature)
- ◐ Mira's tentative approach (inferred from sensitive material)
- ◐ Progressive building of trust
- ◐ Ilya's growing file of evidence

**DRAMATIC LICENSE** (Tier 3):
- ○ Specific dialogue: "Can we talk? Privately?"
- ○ Conference room settings
- ○ Mira showing phone screens
- ○ Ilya's facial expressions
- ○ "Look at this. There's more. A lot more."

**MAJOR CREATIVE FREEDOM**:
- ○ Mira's motivations - NEVER EXPLAINED IN TESTIMONY
  - Was she whistleblowing?
  - Manipulating?
  - Just venting?
  - We can show her ambiguously and let audience decide

**JUSTIFICATION**: Testimony confirms Mira gave screenshots to Ilya throughout this period; specific scenes and dialogue are necessary dramatic interpretation

**TRANSPARENCY NOTE**: Information sharing confirmed; manner and motivations are interpreted

---

### **The "Jakub Incident"**

**DOCUMENTED FACT** (Tier 1):
- ✓ Referenced in 52-page memo at page 548
- ✓ Ilya's characterization: "Involves Sam lying, undermining Mira, undermining Ilya, and pitting Jakub against Ilya. Joint work with Greg and Jakub" (p.316)
- ✓ About conflicting visions for how company would be run

**NOT DOCUMENTED**:
- ✗ When it happened (no date given)
- ✗ What specifically was said
- ✗ Jakub's perspective
- ✗ Whether it actually was lying or misunderstanding

**DRAMATIC LICENSE** (Tier 2-3):
- ○ Can create scene showing what Ilya believed happened
- ○ Can show it was based on Mira's account
- ○ Can create ambiguity about whether Sam actually lied or was misinterpreted
- ○ Dialogue is invented but based on described pattern

**JUSTIFICATION**: Incident referenced in testimony but not detailed; can be reconstructed based on Ilya's characterization

**TRANSPARENCY NOTE**: Incident confirmed to exist; specifics are dramatic interpretation based on secondhand description

**CREATIVE OPPORTUNITY**: Show same scene multiple ways:
1. As Mira might have perceived it
2. As Mira described it to Ilya
3. As Ilya included it in memo
4. What might actually have happened

**DRAMATIC LICENSE** (Tier 3):
- ○ Specific wording of Helen's statement (within bounds of "even more direct")

**JUSTIFICATION**: Statement confirmed; exact wording can be interpreted within bounds of testimony

## IV. DIALOGUE - RULES FOR INVENTION

### **TIER 1 - Must Use Exactly**
Direct quotes from deposition testimony

**Examples**:
- "Termination." (p.131)
- "At least a year." (p.325)
- "I fully believed the information that Mira was giving me." (p.310)
- "I've learned the critical importance of firsthand knowledge for matters like this." (p.312)

**RULE**: When using deposition dialogue, use EXACTLY as testified

---

### **TIER 2 - Can Paraphrase with Attribution**
Testimony about what was said in past conversations

**Example**:
- Testimony: "Helen Toner said something to the effect of that it is consistent"
- Can dramatize as: HELEN: "Actually, that would be consistent with the mission."

**RULE**: Base on testimony but can craft specific wording within bounds described

---

### **TIER 3 - Can Invent for Documented Scenes**
Conversations we know happened but don't have transcript

**Examples**:
- Mira sharing screenshots with Ilya (know it happened, not exact words)
- Board meetings (know they occurred, not exact dialogue)
- Sam being fired (know call happened, not exact words)

**RULE**: Dialogue should be:
- Consistent with character voice from testimony
- Consistent with documented outcomes
- Plausible given context
- Not contradicting any known facts

---

### **TIER 4 - Invented Transitional Scenes**
Scenes that likely happened but not documented

**Examples**:
- Ilya compiling memo (alone, so no dialogue needed)
- Ilya packing up office
- Employees discussing situation

**RULE**: Should feel natural and serve story, not contradict facts

---

## V. VISUAL STORYTELLING - LICENSE AREAS

### **Can Freely Invent**:
- ○ Office layouts and design
- ○ Lighting and color palette
- ○ Camera angles and movement
- ○ How screenshots appear on screen
- ○ Visualization of the 52-page memo

- ✓ Videotaped deposition
- ✓ Multiple lawyers present
- ✓ General geography (D.C., San Francisco, etc.)

---

## VI. THEMATIC INTERPRETATIONS - LICENSE ALLOWED

### **Can Emphasize Through Creative Choices**:

**Secondhand Knowledge Theme**:
- ○ Visual "telephone game" showing information degradation
- ○ Showing same scene multiple ways
- ○ Reality vs. perception split screens

**Time and Reflection**:
- ○ Color palette shifts
- ○ Visual aging or passage of time
- ○ Present/past transitions

**Isolation**:
- ○ Ilya alone in frame
- ○ Physical distance in shots
- ○ Video call boxes emphasizing separation

**Mission vs. Reality**:
- ○ Contrast between idealistic founding and harsh reality
- ○ Visual motifs connecting to mission statement

**Justified by**: Themes emerge from documented facts; visual expression is creative choice

---

## VII. WHAT WE ABSOLUTELY CANNOT DO

### **FORBIDDEN**:

1. ✗ Change documented outcomes

---

## VIII. RESEARCH PRIORITIES TO REDUCE LICENSE NEEDS

### **Can Probably Find**:
- Helen Toner's article (October 2023) - likely public
- Exact text of Ilya's regret tweet - archived
- News coverage November 18-23, 2023 - public record
- Public announcements from OpenAI - press releases
- Board member departures - public records
- Employee letter text - may be available
- Microsoft statements - public

### **Probably Cannot Find**:
- Full text of Exhibit 19 (Attorneys' Eyes Only)
- Greg Brockman memo (not produced)
- Private communications
- Secret board meeting minutes
- Anthropic merger proposal details

**STRATEGY**: Research what's available to minimize invention; acknowledge limitations

---

## IX. TRANSPARENCY MECHANISMS
