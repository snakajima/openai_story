- Calculation: Started late 2022 or earlier

**Dramatic Function**: Plant seeds of discontent, show long-building tension

**Visual**: Ilya watching from the shadows, executives leaving Sam's office frustrated

---

### **DOCUMENTATION PERIOD (Spring-Summer 2023)**

**Emotional State**: Active, methodical, careful

**Transformation**: Passive Observer → Active Gatherer

**Key Relationship**: Mira Murati becomes confidant

- No verification: "It didn't occur to me" (repeated)

**Internal Logic**:
- "I fully believed the information that Mira was giving me" (p.310)
- Complete trust in Mira
- No skepticism about secondhand nature

**Dramatic Function**: Show meticulous preparation contrasted with fundamental flaw (no verification)

**Key Quote**: "I fully believed the information that Mira was giving me."

**Character Note**: This is where Ilya's tragic flaw emerges - trust without verification

---

### **CONSPIRACY PHASE (October-November 2023)**

**Emotional State**: Decisive, certain, paranoid about leaks

**Transformation**: Gatherer → Activist

**Inciting Incident**: Helen Toner article (October 2023)
- Ilya initially wants Helen removed: "not far from obviously inappropriate" (p.306)
- Discussed with Sam about removing her
- "At least at one point, I expressed support" for removing Helen (p.307)

**Critical Shift**: Board departures create opening
- "I had been waiting for a moment when the board dynamics would allow for Altman to be replaced" (WSJ article, confirmed p.324)
- Waiting for: "majority of the board is not obviously friendly with Sam" (p.324)
- **The moment arrives**

**Transformation**: From wanting Helen removed → Allying with Helen to remove Sam
- Timeline: Weeks apart
- Shows pragmatic shift or desperate alliance

**The 52-Page Memo**:
- Commissioned by board (likely Adam D'Angelo) (p.129)
- "I was worried that those memos will somehow leak" (p.131)
- Uses disappearing emails
- First page: "Sam exhibits a consistent pattern of lying, undermining his execs, and pitting his execs against one another" (p.130)
- 52 pages total

**Decision Point**: "Termination" (p.131)
- One word, no hesitation in testimony
- Decisive, certain

**Emotional State**: Controlled paranoia + certainty
- Worried about leaks (disappearing emails)
- Certain about correctness of action
- No doubt expressed in testimony about appropriateness

**Dramatic Function**: Show certainty before the fall, conspiracy thriller elements

**Key Quotes**:
- "Termination." (one word answer)
- "I was worried that those memos will somehow leak."
- "At least a year." (how long he'd been considering it)

**Character Note**: Ilya is absolutely certain at this point - makes the collapse more tragic

---

### **EXECUTION DAY (November 18, 2023)**

**Emotional State**: Determined, expectant, then shocked

**Morning - The Firing**:
- Action taken
- Plan executed
- Silicon Valley shocked

**Expectation vs. Reality**:
- **Expected**: Employees neutral or mildly supportive
  - "I had not expected them to cheer, but I have not expected them to feel strongly either way" (p.326)
  - "That's what I thought" (p.326)

- **Reality**: Immediate revolt
  - Mass resignation threats
  - Employee fury
  - Loyalty to Sam overwhelming

**Realization**: Massive miscalculation
- Watching from office window
- Employees gathering, angry
- Everything going wrong

**Dramatic Function**: Peripeteia (reversal of fortune) - the moment everything changes

**Key Quote**: "I have not expected them to feel strongly either way."

**Character Note**: Naivete about human relationships and loyalty revealed

---

### **CRISIS WEEKEND (November 18-20, 2023) - The Collapse**

**Emotional State**: Spiraling loss of control → horror → breaking

**Saturday/Sunday - Anthropic Merger Proposal**:

**Emotional Response**: "I was very unhappy about it" (p.320)

**Core Reaction**:
- "Because I really did not want OpenAI to merge with Anthropic" (p.320)
- Simple, emotional: "I just didn't want to" (p.320)
- Visceral rejection

**Isolation**:
- Other board members "a lot more supportive" (p.321)
- Helen "most supportive" of merger (p.321)
- Ilya alone in opposition
- Losing control of situation he initiated

**Transformation**: Leader → Isolated dissenter on his own board

**Helen's Destruction Statement**:

**The Moment**: Executives say OpenAI will be destroyed without Sam, that's inconsistent with mission

**Helen's Response**: "Something to the effect of that it is consistent, but I think she said it even more directly than that" (p.307)

**Ilya's Internal Response**:
- "I could imagine hypothetical extreme circumstances that answer would be 'Yes'"
- "But at that point in time, the answer was definitely 'No' for me" (p.308)

**Realization**: He's allied with someone willing to destroy OpenAI for ideological purity

**Emotional State**: Horror, recognition of mistake

**The Breaking Point**:
- Sunday night, alone
- Everything collapsing
- Employee revolt intensifying
- Microsoft offering to hire everyone
- The company he tried to save is dying

**The Tweet**:
- "I deeply regret my participation in the board's actions"
- Public reversal
- Emotional breaking point

**Transformation**: Certain Leader → Broken Regretful Participant

**Dramatic Function**: Complete reversal, emotional climax, public vulnerability

**Key Quotes**:
- "I really did not want OpenAI to merge with Anthropic."
- "I just didn't want to."
- "The answer was definitely 'No' for me."
- "I deeply regret" (tweet)

**Character Note**: This is Ilya's lowest point - certainty shattered, control lost, public regret

---

### **AFTERMATH (Late 2023 - May 2024)**

**Emotional State**: Diminished, estranged, staying on

**Status**:
- Sam reinstated within 5 days
- Board resigns (not Ilya - he was already member)
- Ilya remains at OpenAI in some capacity
- Relationships fractured

**Relationship with Sam**:
- Distance growing
- Last spoke: "ten months ago, a year ago" from Oct 2025 depo = Oct 2024-Dec 2024 (p.355)
- Never discussed lawsuit (p.355)

**Relationship with Greg**:
- Even more distant
- Last spoke: "a year and a quarter ago" from Oct 2025 = July-Aug 2024 (p.355)

**Internal State**:
- Processing the failure
- "A big new vision" forming (p.349)

**May 2024 - Departure**:
- Leaves OpenAI
- Reason: "Ultimately, I had a big new vision, and it felt more suitable for a new company" (p.349)
- Not forced out, but chosen exit
- Retains equity

**Dramatic Function**: Quiet exit, dignity in departure, moving forward

**Key Quote**: "I had a big new vision, and it felt more suitable for a new company."

**Character Note**: Ilya doesn't burn bridges, leaves with some grace despite catastrophic failure

---

### **PRESENT DAY (October 2025) - Deposition**

**Emotional State**: Reflective, measured, careful, wiser but estranged

**Physical State**:
- 10-hour deposition (10:19 AM - 8:07 PM)
- Exhausting
- Lawyers fighting around him
- Still caught up in the aftermath

**Transformation**: Certainty → Wisdom

**Core Learning**: "I've learned the critical importance of firsthand knowledge for matters like this" (p.312)

**Self-Assessment**:
- Process was "rushed" (p.301)
- Board was "inexperienced" in "board matters" (p.301)
- Secondhand knowledge is "an invitation for further investigation" (p.312)

**No Direct Regret About Action**:
- "Have you since learned facts that have changed your view?"
- "No." (p.312)
- Regrets METHOD not GOAL

**Financial Reality**:
- Still holds OpenAI equity (p.351)
- Value has "increased" since departure (p.352)
- OpenAI likely paying his legal fees (p.357)
- Complex ongoing relationship despite estrangement

**Emotional Complexity**:
- Broke relationships with Sam and Greg
- Still financially tied to OpenAI's success
- Benefits from company thriving under Sam's leadership
- Testifying in lawsuit against the company
- But OpenAI paying his lawyers

**Safe Superintelligence**:
- New company, "new and different kind of research" (p.354)
- "I have a new idea of how to do things" (p.354)
- Still pursuing AI safety mission
- On his own terms now

**Dramatic Function**: Resolution, reflection, complex legacy

**Key Quotes**:
- "I've learned the critical importance of firsthand knowledge for matters like this."
- "The process was rushed because the board was inexperienced."
- "I had a big new vision."

**Character Note**: Ilya has grown and learned, but at tremendous personal cost - broken relationships, failed coup, but still committed to mission

---

### **ILYA'S COMPLETE ARC SUMMARY**

**Tragic Flaw**: Trust without verification, naivete about human relationships

**Journey**: Idealism → Concern → Action → Certainty → Collapse → Regret → Wisdom

**What He Gains**: Understanding of firsthand knowledge importance, humility about process

**What He Loses**: Relationships with co-founders, position at OpenAI, reputation (partially)

**What Remains**: Mission commitment, new company, financial security, dignity

**Dramatic Archetype**: Tragic hero who learns but pays heavy price

**Audience Relationship**: Sympathetic - he meant well, acted from principle, but made catastrophic errors in judgment

---

### **WHAT WE KNOW FROM TESTIMONY**

**Role**: CTO of OpenAI

**Primary Function in Story**: Information source for Ilya
- "Most of the screenshots that I have... I get them from Mira Murati" (p.129)

- Greg was "essentially fired from Stripe" (p.310)
- Various management behavior patterns

**Ilya's Trust Level**: "I fully believed the information that Mira was giving me" (p.310)

---

### **WHAT WE DON'T KNOW (Dramatic Opportunities)**

**Her Motivations**:
- Was she conscientiously whistleblowing?
- Was she venting to a sympathetic ear?
- Was she manipulating Ilya to remove Sam?
- Was she documenting for legitimate concerns?
- Personal grievance against Sam?

**Her Awareness**:
- Did she know Ilya was compiling a memo?
- Did she know the board might fire Sam?
- Was she surprised by November 18?
- Did she support the firing?

**Her Relationship with Sam**:
- Why was she documenting his behavior?
- What was the nature of their working relationship?
- The "subtle retaliation" section (p.564) suggests tension
- Her performance review of Sam was critical

**How She Got Private Information**:
- Greg-Sam text messages (p.570) - how did CTO access these?
- System access? Forwarded by others? Shared voluntarily?
- Raises questions about trust, surveillance, privacy

**Her Role During Crisis**:
- Where was she November 18-20?
- Did she support the firing?
- Did she sign the employee letter?
- Did she communicate with Ilya?

**Post-Crisis**:
- Is she still at OpenAI?
- Relationship with Sam after his return?
- Does she know Ilya used her information in the memo?

---

### **DRAMATIC POTENTIAL - Three Interpretations**

**INTERPRETATION 1: The Conscientious Whistleblower**
- Genuinely concerned about Sam's management
- Documented objectively
- Shared with Ilya because he was Chief Scientist and board member
- Believed someone should know
- Didn't anticipate it would lead to firing
- Horrified by the outcome

**Emotional Arc**: Concern → Documentation → Shock → Regret
**Sympathy Level**: High
**Character Type**: Tragic enabler

---

**INTERPRETATION 2: The Manipulator**
- Wanted Sam removed
- Couldn't do it herself (not on board)
- Used Ilya as proxy
- Carefully curated information to build case
- Knew exactly what she was doing
- May have had personal motivations

**Emotional Arc**: Grievance → Planning → Manipulation → [Unknown outcome]
**Sympathy Level**: Low
**Character Type**: Lady Macbeth figure

---

**INTERPRETATION 3: The Venter (Most Likely)**
- Frustrated with Sam's management style
- Venting to Ilya as colleague/friend
- Sharing screenshots casually, not building case
- Didn't anticipate Ilya would compile it all
- Didn't know about the memo or firing plan
- Shocked when it happened
- Just needed someone to talk to

**Emotional Arc**: Frustration → Venting → Shock → Guilt
**Sympathy Level**: Medium-High
**Character Type**: Unwitting catalyst

---

### **NARRATIVE FUNCTION**

**As Plot Device**:
- Provides all evidence that drives the action
- Without Mira, no memo, no firing
- Catalyst for entire crisis

**As Mystery**:
- Audience never knows her full motivations
- Creates ambiguity and discussion
- "Was she right to share this information?"
- "Did she know what would happen?"

**As Thematic Element**:
- Embodiment of the "secondhand knowledge" theme
- Information passes through her
- Reality → Mira → Ilya → Board
- Each step adds interpretation/distortion

**As Character Study**:
- Complex female character in male-dominated tech
- CTO caught between CEO and Chief Scientist
- Her performance review of Sam shows she had concerns
- "Subtle retaliation" suggests she experienced pushback

---

### **SUGGESTED DRAMATIC APPROACH**

**Keep Her Mysterious**:
- Show her sharing information with Ilya
- Don't fully explain her motivations
- Let audience interpret
- Show multiple possible readings

**Visual Approach**:
- Often in shadows, backlit
- Close-ups of her phone showing screenshots
- Face hard to read
- Body language ambiguous

**Dialogue Approach**:
- Careful, measured
- "Look at this" not "We need to do something about this"
- Factual presentation, not editorial
- Let Ilya draw conclusions

**Key Scenes**:
1. First time sharing screenshot with Ilya - tentative
2. Later meetings - more comfortable, more screenshots
3. The Jakub incident - specific frustration shown
4. [Possibly] Her reaction when she learns Sam was fired - shocked? vindicated? horrified?

**Question to Leave Unanswered**: Did she know?

---

### **MIRA'S ARC SUMMARY**

**Role**: Catalyst / Information Source / Mystery

**What We Know**: Gave Ilya screenshots and secondhand information throughout Spring-Summer 2023

**What We Don't Know**: Her motivations, awareness of consequences, current status

**Dramatic Function**: Embodies secondhand knowledge theme, creates moral ambiguity, drives plot

**Audience Relationship**: Curious, uncertain, wanting to know more

**Key Quote**: "Most of the screenshots that I have... I get them from Mira Murati."

---

## III. HELEN TONER - The Ideologue

### **Character Type**: True Believer / Extremist

### **Core Characteristic**
- Mission purity over organizational survival
- Willing to destroy OpenAI to remain "consistent with the mission"
- Ideological certainty without pragmatic constraint

---

### **BACKGROUND**

**Position**: OpenAI Board Member (independent director)

**Expertise**: AI safety, policy

**Location**: Washington D.C. (at least part-time) (p.301)
- Often remote for board meetings
- Not always physically present

**Connection to Anthropic Ecosystem**:
- Open Philanthropy connections
- Holden Karnofsky (married to Helen) connected to Daniela Amodei
- This network becomes important during Anthropic merger talks

---

### **ACT II - THE TONER ARTICLE (October 2023)**

**Inciting Incident**: Helen publishes article praising Anthropic

**Content**:
- Praised Anthropic (OpenAI's rival)
- Criticized OpenAI (specifics not detailed in deposition)

**Sam's Reaction**: Furious, wants Helen removed from board

**Ilya's Assessment**:
- "I found it a strange article" (p.305)
- "I found it a strange thing for her to do" (p.305)
- "I thought it was not far from obviously inappropriate" (p.306)

**Discussion of Removing Helen**:
- Ilya discussed with Sam about removing Helen (p.306)
- "At least at one point, I expressed support" for removing her (p.307)

**Irony**:
- Helen nearly removed in October
- Weeks later, Helen leads effort to remove Sam
- Ilya switches from opposing Helen to allying with her

**Transformation for Ilya**: Potential enemy → Essential ally

---

### **ACT III - THE CONSPIRACY**

**Alliance Formation**:
- Ilya approaches Helen (or she approaches him after board changes)
- Helen brings in Adam D'Angelo and Tasha McCauley
- Independent directors united

**Role**:
- Likely received the 52-page memo
- Part of secret board meetings
- Made decision for "Termination"

**Character Note**: Helen transformed from liability to leader of the removal effort

---

### **ACT IV - EXECUTION**

**November 18 Firing**:
- Part of decision
- Executed the plan
- [Specific role not detailed in testimony]

**Character**: Decisive, certain in her convictions

---

### **ACT V - THE MOST REVEALING MOMENTS**

### **Anthropic Merger Advocacy**

**The Contact**:
- "I don't know whether it was Helen who reached out to Anthropic or whether Anthropic reached out to Helen" (Ilya, p.319)
- Given Helen's Anthropic article and network connections, likely Helen initiated

**The Proposal**:
- Anthropic merge with OpenAI
- Anthropic leadership "take over" (p.319)
- Saturday or Sunday, November 18-19

**Helen's Position**: "Most supportive" of the merger (p.321)

**Dramatic Significance**:
- Board fires Sam to protect OpenAI
- Then immediately considers handing OpenAI to rival company
- Helen advocates for this
- Shows her priorities: Anthropic's approach > OpenAI's survival

**Ilya's Reaction**: "Very unhappy," isolation from his own board

---

### **The Destruction Statement - Helen's Defining Moment**

**Context**: Meeting with board and executive team

**Executives' Position**: "If Sam does not return, then OpenAI will be destroyed, and that's inconsistent with OpenAI's mission" (p.307)

**Helen's Response**: "Something to the effect of that it is consistent"

**Ilya's Testimony**: "But I think she said it even more directly than that" (p.307)

**IMPLICATION**: Helen said even more explicitly that destroying OpenAI would be consistent with the mission

**Possible actual statement** (dramatic interpretation):
- "Destroying OpenAI IS consistent with the mission"
- Or even stronger
- Cold, matter-of-fact delivery

**Reactions**: Shocked silence, jaws dropping

**Ilya's Internal Response**: "At that point in time, the answer was definitely 'No' for me" (p.308)

---

### **HELEN'S PHILOSOPHY - Ideological Purity**

**Core Belief**: Mission purity > organizational survival

**Logic**:
- If OpenAI deviates from mission, it should not exist
- Better no OpenAI than wrong OpenAI
- Destruction preferable to corruption of values

**Extremism**: Willing to sacrifice the organization for principles

**Comparison to Ilya**:
- Ilya: Mission-driven but wants OpenAI to survive
- Helen: Mission-driven even if OpenAI dies
- Ilya horrified by her position

**Dramatic Function**: Shows the extreme end of AI safety ideology

---

### **ACT VI - EXIT**

**The Reversal**:
- Within 5 days, Sam reinstated
- Helen resigns from board (along with other independent directors)
- OpenAI survives despite her

**Outcome**: Her vision rejected, her board position lost

**Legacy**: Nearly destroyed OpenAI in attempt to save it

---

### **HELEN'S COMPLETE ARC**

**Journey**: Concerned Board Member → Article Writer → Removal Leader → Merger Advocate → Extremist Statement → Exit

**Core Belief**: Ideological purity over pragmatism

**Dramatic Function**: Represents AI safety extremism, pushes Ilya too far, shows consequences of rigid ideology

**Tragic Element**: Her principles are arguably valid (AI safety matters) but her methods and extremism are catastrophic

**Character Complexity**:
- Not a villain - genuinely believes in AI safety
- Not a hero - willing to destroy to maintain purity
- True believer whose certainty becomes dangerous

**Relationship with Ilya**:
- Starts: Potentially hostile (Ilya wants her removed)
- Middle: Allied (united against Sam)
- End: Divergent (Ilya rejects her extremism)

**Key Quotes**:
- [Article praising Anthropic]
- "Something to the effect of that it is consistent, but I think she said it even more directly than that."

**Audience Relationship**: Fascinating, unsettling, thought-provoking

**Question She Raises**: When does principled stance become dangerous extremism?

---

## IV. SAM ALTMAN - The Absent Presence

### **Character Type**: Antagonist / Absent King

### **Unique Dramatic Approach**
- Largely absent from Ilya's POV
- More powerful in absence than presence
- Defined by others' perceptions and allegations
- Never speaks in his own defense (in this story)
- Vindicated by events, not words

### **Character Arc Structure**

### **PROLOGUE - THE FOUNDING**

**Character**: Co-founder alongside Elon and Ilya

**Vision**: "A non-profit. Open source. Transparent."

**Relationship with Ilya**: United, co-founders, shared mission

**Dramatic Irony**: Audience knows this will end in betrayal

---

### **ACT I-II - THE ALLEGATIONS (Through Ilya's Eyes)**

**NOTE**: Everything we "know" about Sam in this period comes from:
- Mira's screenshots to Ilya
- Ilya's interpretation
- Never verified
- Potentially distorted

**The Alleged Pattern** (from 52-page memo):

1. **"Sam exhibits a consistent pattern of lying, undermining his execs, and pitting his execs against one another"** (p.130)

2. **The Jakub Incident**: "Involves Sam lying, undermining Mira, undermining Ilya, and pitting Jakub against Ilya" (p.316)

3. **"Pitting People Against Each Other"**:
   - Daniela vs. Mira
   - Dario vs. Greg, Ilya
   - (All from Mira, per p.314)

4. **Y Combinator Allegation**:
   - "Sam was pushed out from YC"
   - "Creating chaos, starting lots of new projects, pitting people against each other" (p.309)
   - Source: Brad Lightcap told Mira told Ilya (triple hearsay)

5. **Lying About GPT-4 Turbo/DSB**: Jason Kwon matter (p.311)

6. **"Subtle Retaliation"**: Against Mira's feedback (p.564)

**Dramatic Approach**:
- SHOW these incidents as Ilya believes them
- Then REVEAL they were secondhand/unverified
- Create doubt about what really happened
- Audience never knows the full truth

**Visual Technique**:
- Scene plays out as described
- Then rewind, show same scene with "ACCORDING TO MIRA" overlay
- Then show Ilya has never verified

---

### **ACT III - THE UNAWARE TARGET**

**Sam's Perspective** (not shown directly but implied):
- Doesn't know about secret board meetings
- Doesn't know about 52-page memo
- Doesn't know Ilya is compiling evidence
- Goes about business as CEO
- Unaware of conspiracy

**Dramatic Irony**: Audience knows what's coming, Sam doesn't

**Character**: Busy CEO, focused on OpenAI growth, blind to threat

---

### **ACT IV - THE FIRING**

**The Moment**:
- Video call
- Told he's terminated
- Simultaneous public announcement

**Sam's Reaction**: Not documented in Ilya's testimony
- We don't see his perspective
- We don't hear his defense
- Absence is powerful

**Dramatic Effect**:
- Sam is victim in this scene
- Audience sympathetic because he can't defend himself
- Empty chair is powerful image

---

### **ACT V - THE EMPLOYEE CHAMPION (Offscreen)**

**What Happens** (not from Ilya's POV):
- Employees immediately revolt
- Mass resignation threats
- "Without Sam, there is no OpenAI" (employee quote)
- Microsoft offers to hire everyone with Sam
- 700+ employees sign letter demanding board resignation

**Sam's Role** (implied but not shown):
- Must be communicating with employees
- Must be negotiating
- Must be fighting back
- But we don't see any of this in Ilya's story

**Dramatic Power**:
- Sam vindicated by employee loyalty
- His absence from screen makes employee reaction more powerful
- We see his influence, not his words

---

### **ACT VI - THE TRIUMPHANT RETURN**

**The Reversal**:
- Within 5 days, reinstated as CEO
- Board resigns
- New board formed (presumably more favorable)
- Sam more powerful than before

**Post-Return**:
- OpenAI valued at $150+ billion (2024)
- Company thriving
- Sam's leadership validated

**Relationship with Ilya**:
- Last spoke "ten months ago, a year ago" (Oct 2024-Dec 2024) (p.355)
- Never discussed lawsuit (p.355)
- Distance, estrangement
- Professional relationship ended

**Final Image**: Sam at OpenAI, powerful, vindicated

**Dramatic Irony**: The coup intended to remove him made him stronger

---

### **SAM'S COMPLETE ARC**

**Journey**: Co-founder → Allegedly Problematic CEO → Fired → Employee Hero → Reinstated Stronger

**What We Never Know**:
- Were the allegations true?
- What really happened in those incidents?
- How did he feel during the crisis?
- What did he think of Ilya?

**Dramatic Function**:
- Antagonist who is absent
- Vindicated by events, not words
- More powerful for being unknowable
- Audience projects onto him

**Relationship with Ilya**:
- United co-founders (2015) → Estranged (2025)
- Never reconciled
- Broken permanently

**Character Complexity**:
- Is he the chaos creator Ilya believed?
- Or the visionary leader employees loved?
- Or both?
- Story leaves it ambiguous

**Key Absence**: Never speaks for himself in this narrative

**Audience Relationship**:

## V. ADAM D'ANGELO - The Steady Hand

### **Character Type**: Pragmatic Independent Director

**Position**: Board member, CEO of Quora

**Role in Story**: Secondary but important

**Characteristics**:
- Most likely requested the memo from Ilya (p.129)
- Independent director
- Less extreme than Helen
- "A lot more supportive" of Anthropic merger than Ilya but less than Helen

**Arc**: Concerned Director → Evidence Requester → Decision Maker → Resign

**Function**: More measured voice on board, contrast to Helen's extremism

**Dramatic Approach**: Show as thoughtful, careful, but ultimately wrong

- Not always physically present at meetings (p.301)
- Interacted with Ilya "not too frequently" (p.301)
- Supported Sam's removal
- "A lot more supportive" of Anthropic merger than Ilya

**Arc**: Minimal development, background presence

**Function**: Shows board dysfunction - how can she make major decisions when rarely present?

**Dramatic Approach**: Often on video screen, distant, disconnected from OpenAI reality

---

## VII. GREG BROCKMAN - The Collateral Damage

### **Character Type**: Secondary Victim

**Position**: President, Co-founder

**Role**:
- Also removed from board during crisis
- Subject of separate memo by Ilya (not produced)
- Close to Sam

**Allegations** (from Ilya's memo):

- Source: Mira Murati told Ilya
- Never verified with Greg

**Relationship with Ilya**:
- Co-founders
- Last spoke "a year and a quarter ago" (July-Aug 2024) (p.355)
- Even more distant than Sam

**Arc**: Co-founder → Target → Removed → Reinstated → Estranged from Ilya

**Function**: Shows collateral damage, Ilya's willingness to turn on multiple co-founders

**The Missing Memo**:
- Ilya wrote separate memo about Greg
- Never produced in discovery
- Mystery document
- Shows systematic approach to removal

---

## VIII. THE EMPLOYEES - The Collective Voice

### **Character Type**: Chorus / Greek Tragedy Element

**Role**: Collective character representing OpenAI culture

**Arc**:
- Neutral/Unaware → Shocked → Outraged → Mobilized → Victorious

**November 18 Reaction**:
- Immediate revolt
- Not the neutrality Ilya expected
- Massive miscalculation by board

**Power**:
- 700+ signatures demanding board resignation
- Threat to leave en masse
- Microsoft hiring offer
- Brought down the board in days

**Dramatic Function**:

- Demonstrates where real power lies (with the people, not the board)
- Greek chorus commenting on action

**Key Revelation**: Ilya completely misunderstood his own company's culture and loyalties
